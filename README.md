# RTIAW

RTIAW is based on the Ray Tracing in a Weekend Project (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) 
and is being developed to add extra features to the OpenGLTest3 project which is a game engine in development. 
To run the project, open to the x64 directory and go to the RTIAW.exe file. Open the directory in the command prompt and run:
RTIAW.exe > image.ppm
to create or update the image, and then view the image from there.
